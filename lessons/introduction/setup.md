# Setup & Requirements

Now that you know what to expect, let's set up your environment.

To follow along this talk you will need to have access to a linux terminal. Any distribution works. I would recommend you to use Ubuntu 22, as this is the one I will be using in the demo.

I am running Ubuntu inside a Docker container. To avoid too much inconvenience, I would suggest you to use Docker. To use docker you need to install Docker Desktop.

### Internet & Storage

This demo will use a fair bit of bandwidth as containers can be quite large. If you’re on metered or slower internet, be aware of that.
